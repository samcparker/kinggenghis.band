Belvita in the morning, Instant plus.
Never will I buy synthetic drugs.

Belvita in the morning it's an organism plus.
Taking the time just to make a fuss.

Belvita in the morning, Fresh Prince of Bell Air.
Jaden Smith for four hours talking Times Square.


Belvita in the morning, it's a crack of a snare.
Will Smith for four hours, my living nightmare.

Never, never, will I ever,
never will I buy your instant plus.
Never, never, will I ever,
never will I buy synthetic drugs.

When you say you're already and you say you're already and you say you're already there.
When you say you're already and you say you're already and you say you're already there.

Belvita in the morning and I see Bill Murray,
Every day I'm living in Groundhog Day.

Belvita in the morning and I see Will Smith.
Taking the time it's a hit and miss.

Belvita in the morning lost the will to Smith.
Fresh prince of Bell Air, conspiracy myth.

Belvita in the morning, my organism plus.
Tell us goodbye, the instant drugs.

Never, never, will I ever,
never will I buy your instant plus.
Never, never, will I ever,
never will I buy your instant plus.

When you say you're already and you say you're already and you say you're already there.
When you say you're already and you say you're already and you say you're already there.

Never, never.
Never, never.

You say you're already and you say you're already-
You say you're already and you say you're already-
